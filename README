SSH Key Manipulation 
	Assuming that the .ssh folder already exists in c:\users\yourUsername\, and that folder contains the properly
	generated ssh keys, that folder must be copied into the system user profile following the steps below:

	* Run the following command in an elevated command prompt in order to run as the local system user.  Note that 
	  Interactive Services Detection will bring up a dialog asking you to "View the message".
		
		sc create testsvc binpath= "cmd /K start" type= own type= interact && sc start testsvc & sc delete testsvc
	
	* Open git bash:
	
		c:> "c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\sh.exe" -login -i

	* Copy the ssh folder to your home directory

		$ cp -r /c/users/yourUsername/.ssh ~/

	* Test SSH connectivity

		$ ssh git@yourserver
		Welcome to GitLab, YOUR NAME!
		Connection to yourserver closed.

Configuration:
	+ Change contents of sinatra_svc.rb to match source git repository
	+ copy appropriate ssh keys to c:\user\servicerunas\.ssh
